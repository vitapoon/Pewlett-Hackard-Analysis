# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose of our project

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, summarizes the analysis and helps prepare the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. I used PostgreSQL to complete my analysis.

## Results

## Task 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
The current criteria for this analysis is to find employees born between 1952 and 1955. The major takeaways from this analysis are:

1, There are 90,396 employees who are likely to retire soon

2, 57,668 employees are senior level employees

3, 43,636 employees are engineers

4, 40,497 employees are staff

5, Only 2 managers need to be replaced

6, Our retiring_titles shows us the a majority of the employees of retirment age (57,668/90,398 = 64%) have senior titles.
