# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose of our project

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, summarizes the analysis and helps prepare the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. I used PostgreSQL to complete my analysis.

## Results

## Task 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title



## Task 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
